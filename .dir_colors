# Configuration file for dircolors, a utility to help you set the
# LS_COLORS environment variable used by GNU ls with the --color option.

# The keywords COLOR, OPTIONS, and EIGHTBIT (honored by the
# slackware version of dircolors) are recognized but ignored.
# (see the scripts in /etc/profile.d/coreutils-dircolors.* to change default
# options in the Slackware aliases)
